# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering with Python 

A machine learning project focused on customer segmentation. 

## Below is a summary of the key points discussed: 

### Objective: 
The project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
This is useful for businesses to identify different customer groups and target them with tailored marketing strategies.

### Dataset: 
The project uses a dataset containing information about customers, including their annual income and spending scores. 
These variables are used to cluster customers into different groups.

### Data Preprocessing: 
Demonstrates how to preprocess the data, including handling missing values, normalizing the data, and selecting the features to be used in the clustering algorithm.

### K-Means Clustering: 
We have used WCSS -> Within Clusters Sum of Squares
The K-Means algorithm is used to show how to choose the number of clusters (k), and the importance of centroids. 
The "elbow method" is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### Implementation in Python: 
The project is implemented using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. walks through the code step by step, showing how to apply the K-Means algorithm to the dataset.

### Visualization: 
After clustering, the results are visualized using scatter plots to show how customers are grouped based on their income and spending habits.

## Conclusion: 
The project concludes by highlighting the importance of customer segmentation in business and how the K-Means clustering technique can be effectively used to achieve this.
